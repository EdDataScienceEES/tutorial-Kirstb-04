# Final Assessment in Data Science 2024: Creating a tutorial


**Overall Tutorial Aim:** 
To give the reader a comprehensive overview of how to use Github, in a tutorial that will act as a part two to the coding club's [Intro to Github for version control](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/git/) tutorial. 

**Background:**

When first starting the Data Science course I was completely new to Github and it took me quite a while to get to grips with it. I had never heard of a markdown document before, I didn't understand what merge conflicts were or how to resolve them, and I couldn't even figure out how to delete and move files about in my repository. I asked around and many of my peers were having the same issues and so when contemplating what I wanted my tutorial to be on I thought it would be very useful to fill these knowledge gaps. This tutorial will therefore cover many of the basics of Github, as well as some of the more complex issues. For the topics covered go to [my tutorial](index.md).
