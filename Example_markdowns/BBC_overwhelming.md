#### Plastic waste is a global issue affecting marine ecosystems across the world. It negatively impacts the marine environment in a multitude of ways, through changing the natural balance of ecosystems, as well as causing marine animals to die. However recent scientific research shows us where this ocean waste comes from and what it's made up of, which could be crucial in tackling the problem.


Initially seen as a good alternative to natural materials, plastic has <ins>_**been in use since the early 20th century**_</ins> with widespread usage largely beginning in the 1950’s. The adoption of this cheap and versatile material into our daily lives has
only increased in the years since, from 2 million tonnes in the 1950’s to <ins>_**more than 450 million tonnes being produced today**_</ins>.  


Alongside this giant leap in consumption however, there has also been a <ins>_**drastic increase in plastic pollution, with 12 million tonnes of plastic waste now entering the ocean every year**_</ins>. This has a major impact on marine life with <ins>_**100,000 marine mammals and turtles being killed annually by plastic pollution**_</ins>. The impact on the marine environment as a whole is major; <ins>_**plastic accumulates in food chains, animals can get stuck in it and consequently choke or starve, it can pollute ecosystems**_</ins>, the list goes on. 

However <ins>_**recent scientific research looks at which countries this plastic comes from and what it’s composed of**_</ins>. By knowing which countries and specific items contribute most to the plastic waste being introduced into our oceans, <ins>_**we can better focus our efforts on the countries contributing the most, and can be more efficient in choosing which plastic items to phase out/find sustainable alternatives for**_</ins>.

## $\color{Purple}{\text{The\ Research}}$
The BBC looked at data on the total plastic contributed to the ocean by each country, and on what types of plastic waste each gloabl region contributes. This data came from journal articles in the scientific journals *Science Advances* and *Nature*, respectively, whilst the raw data came from Our World of Data. For the references to these articles and the raw data see the [References](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/tutorial-Kirstb-04/blob/master/Example_markdowns/BBC_overwhelming.md#colorpurpletextreferences) section below. This data was used to create the figure below. 

From the below figure we can see that the five main contributors to ocean plastic are bottle lids, drink cans, food cans, clothing, and fishing nets, however drink cans are the main contributor. We can also see that the countries contributing the most plastic to the oceans include Brazil, China, and India.

$\color{Orange}{\text{A\ note\ about\ the\ graph\ section\ of\ the\ figure:\}}$ only the top five most common waste items were included as they accounted for 60 % of all plastic waste.

> The Left panel on this figure shows the percentage of total waste for each global region as well as what type of waste is contributed by each region

> The right panel on this figure shows the share of global plastics emitted to the ocean as a percentage for each country; the grey colour means that there is no data present for that country


<ins>_**Plastic pollution is a global issue which is leading to harmful consequences for our marine environments. However, through the use of scientific data we can pinpoint where this plastic is coming from, and the key plastic items that we need to phase out of our lives.**_</ins>
