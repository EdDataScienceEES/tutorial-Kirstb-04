Do you want to make exciting and interactive README.md files? Do you want to easily change file names, and move files about in Github but don’t know how to? Well then, this tutorial is for you! When people are first introduced to Github they can find it confusing and hard to follow (as I did initially) but through some simple hacks and codes, you will soon be a Github pro! 


This tutorial follows on from the [Intro to Github for version control](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/git/) Coding Club tutorial where you can learn how to connect up your R studio with Github, and how version control works (go there now if you’re completely new to Github!). For those who have completed that tutorial or are already familiar with Github, carry on reading!

## 3. Bonus section - General tips for a professional markdown

The style and layout of your markdown will vary depending on your specific project, but these are some general tips that will no doubt apply to many situations, read on to find out!

When trying to make a document look good it can be easy to under or over do-it. Plain black and white text is proffessional right? Adding lots of colours and pictures will make it more interesing! No and no. It's tricky but you need to find a balance. A plain document can be boring and tedious to read, whilst a document that uses an array of colours and pictures without adding to the readers understanding, can be overwhelming and unproffessional. 

For example look at these three markdown examples on creating a BBC news story:
1. [Too simple](Example_markdowns/BBC_too_simple.md)

The paragraphs of text in this example immediately gives the sense that it's more of an essay than a README document, and it therefore doesn't engage or entice the viewer to read on. 
  
2. [Too messy](Example_markdowns/BBC_overwhelming.md)

   <img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a26de187-f2fd-47ac-aea5-3c339b138ea7">


On the other hand this example looks more like a school project than a proffessional document to be taken seriously. It has no set formatting e.g. different picture sizes and alignments, a range of text colours, and overuse of underlining and making words bold, and so looks messy and unproffessional. 

3. [Just right](Example_markdowns/BBC_good.md)

  <img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c9f1349-06c0-4c1a-8f36-0dff6c3910d9">



This is a good mix of these two. It has a set format throughout, and only uses images and colours where necessary. It both engages the viewer but also provides only the necessary information, resulting in a concise and professional README document.
