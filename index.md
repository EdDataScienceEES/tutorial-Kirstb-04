Do you want to make exciting and interactive README.md files? Do you want to easily change file names, and move files about in Github but don’t know how to? Well then, this tutorial is for you! When people are first introduced to Github they can find it confusing and hard to follow (as I did initially) but through some simple hacks and codes, you will soon be a Github pro! 


This tutorial follows on from the [Intro to Github for version control](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/git/) Coding Club tutorial where you can learn how to connect up your R studio with Github, and how version control works (go there now if you’re completely new to Github!). For those who have completed that tutorial or are already familiar with Github, carry on reading!

When trying to make a document look good it can be easy to under or over do-it. Plain black and white text  is proffessional right? Adding lots of colours and pictures will make it more interesing! No and no. It's tricky but you need to find a balance. A plain document can be boring and tedious to read, whilst a document that uses an array of colours and pictures without adding to the readers understanding, can be overwhelming and unproffessional.
